### Some tips for navigation in the Shell

Today I've learned a few new things for the shell in Linux and macOS.
When navigating through a long command in a shell I've wondered if there are other ways except using [alt] + left || [alt] + right arrows.
Some key combinations for navigations:

[esc] + b = jumps to the beginning of the current word

[esc] + f = jumps to the end of the current word

[ctrl] + a = jumps to the beginning of a line

(maybe a as from "Anfang" in German = translates to "beginning" in English)



[ctrl] + e = jumps to the end of a line

(maybe e as from "Ende" in German = translates to "end" in English)



[ctrl] + k = deletes everything right from the courser

[ctrl] + u = deletes everything left from the courser



I think I'll update this post with more stuff I learn regarding this topic
