Recently I changed the password of my user in macOS.

I noticed that during the boot I had to enter still my old password to unlock FileFault.

FileFault is active on all my Laptops and Laptops in the family. Stationary Macs don't have it active when I use them as a "headless" server without a display.

Back to my problem, I only want to have one password for that user, the same for FileFault and for the login.

Well, there are 2 ways how to change the password of a user.

When FileFault is active and I want to have the same password for FileFault as well as for the login then the easiest way is this 2nd option. You can find both options in System Preferences.

Settings > Users & Groups > Change Password
Settings > Security & Privacy > Change Password
